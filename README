Translatable makes adding language translation functions to your site as easy as appending a CSS class to any content you want to enable translations on.


Usage
=====

First, you need to load jQuery, the Google Language AJAX api and Translatable.

<script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
<script>
  google.load("jquery", "1.3.2");
  google.load("language", "1");
</script>
<script src="/javascripts/translatable.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Then, simply add a CSS class of .translatable to anything you want to enable translation on.

<p class='translatable'>
  Your users can now translate this into any language that you enable in the translatable.js file.
</p>

<div class='translatable'>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>
    Or you can wrap multiple elements and apply translation to all of them at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    Source language is detected automatically, so you can even use it for user-generated content where you're unsure of what language it's written in.
  </p>
</div>
